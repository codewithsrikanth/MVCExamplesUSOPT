Validations: 
- It is nothing but verifying the user's input while integracting with the application.
- In web development we have two types of validations
	- Client Side Validations
		- These validations are performed at browser level by using Javascript and it's libraries.
		- Everything can't be handled by using Javascript/client side
		- User can stop executing javascript from browser level.

	- Server Side Validations
		- To perform server side validation we use "Data Annotations".
		- It is an attribute class, which can be defined at model class property level.
		- Examples:
			- [Required]
			- [Range]
			- [StringLength]
			- [Min]
			- [Max]
			- [EmailAddress] etc.
